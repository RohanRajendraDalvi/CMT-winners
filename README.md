# ❄️ SnowSense

**Smart traction risk detection and coaching for winter driving**

---

### 🚗 Overview

Winter driving accidents rise sharply due to hidden traction loss on black ice and snow-covered roads. **SnowSense** is a GenAI-powered mobile system that detects micro-slips and traction risks in real time using only smartphone sensors (and optionally, vehicle OBD data). The app nudges drivers with subtle “⚠️ Traction Risk Ahead” alerts and provides post-trip coaching to help them adapt driving behavior safely in winter conditions.

### 🌨️ Problem

Traditional navigation apps don’t sense real-world grip or traction. Drivers often realize too late when roads are icy or tires begin to slip. SnowSense bridges this gap by combining real-time sensor fusion and contextual learning to **predict and prevent loss of control events** before they happen.

---

### 🧠 How It Works

* **Sensor Fusion:** Uses phone accelerometer, gyroscope, GPS, and optional OBD-II data (wheel speed, brake pressure).
* **Slip Detection:** Detects micro “jerks” — small but significant lateral or longitudinal deviations — that indicate low traction.
* **Context Awareness:** Integrates weather API and location tiles for snow/ice risk zones.
* **Driver Feedback:** Provides gentle voice or visual alerts (“Traction risk ahead”) and post-trip insights (“2 risky turns detected”).
* **Privacy First:** All processing and risk scoring happen **on-device**. Only aggregated risk maps are shared.

### 🧩 Data Pipeline

1. **Sensor Ingestion:** Mobile IMU + GPS + OBD optional
2. **Feature Extraction:** Lateral jerk, wheel slip, traction index
3. **Labeling:** “Slip events” from harsh braking, ABS-like vibrations
4. **Model:** On-device anomaly detection / reinforcement-based adaptive threshold
5. **Alert & Coaching:** Real-time cues + daily safety summaries

### 📊 Impact Metrics

* % Reduction in risky maneuvers on snowy days
* Speed compliance during low-traction conditions
* Driver engagement and adaptation rates

---

### 🔒 Privacy & Ethics

* All computation and scoring are on-device.
* Shared data are **aggregated, anonymized, and tile-based** (never personal trajectories).
* Users remain in full control of data sharing.

---

### 🧰 Tech Stack

* **Frontend:** Flutter / React Native (Mobile UI)
* **Backend (optional):** FastAPI or Firebase for aggregated map tiles
* **ML / Analytics:** TensorFlow Lite, PyTorch Mobile
* **APIs:** OpenWeatherMap, OBD-II Bluetooth adapters

---

### 🚀 Future Directions

* Integration with vehicle ADAS systems
* Cross-season adaptation (rain, fog, heat)
* Gamified safety scoring and community alerts

Would you like me to make this more **technical (for a hackathon repo)** or more **public-facing (for GitHub discovery & sharing)**? I can tailor the tone and structure accordingly.
